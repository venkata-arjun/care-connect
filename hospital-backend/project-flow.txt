### **Project: Hospital Appointment System**

Stack: **React + Node/Express + PostgreSQL**
Goal: Master SQL + Full-stack fundamentals with real business logic.

---

## **Phase 1 — Backend + Database Foundation**

1. **Project setup**

   * Initialize Node project
   * Install Express, PostgreSQL client (pg), bcrypt, JWT

2. **Database design**
   Tables with constraints and indexes:

   ```
   patients
   doctors
   appointments
   prescriptions
   ```

   Relationships:

   * patient ↔ appointments = one-to-many
   * doctor ↔ appointments = one-to-many
   * appointments ↔ prescriptions = one-to-one

3. **Migrations + seed data**

   * Create schema
   * Insert mock doctors and patients

4. **Core backend features**

   * Auth (signup/login) for patients + doctors + admin
   * CRUD APIs for patients, doctors, appointments
   * Check: prevent overlapping appointments
   * Query filters: by date, by doctor, history, status

5. **API Testing**

   * Postman collection

Completion checkpoint:
Backend fully working with a real SQL structure.

---

## **Phase 2 — Frontend + UI**

1. **React setup**

   * Routing (React Router)
   * State handling (Context or Redux)

2. **Authentication UI**

   * Login/signup forms
   * Role-based navigation

3. **Patient views**

   * Book appointment: show available doctors + date/time
   * View appointment history + prescription details
   * Cancel appointment

4. **Doctor views**

   * Dashboard with upcoming appointments
   * Add/view prescriptions for each completed visit

5. **Admin views**

   * Manage doctors
   * Dashboard analytics (simple counts)

Completion checkpoint:
Full UI with protected pages and smooth workflows.

---

## **Phase 3 — Production Quality**

1. **Security**

   * Secure password hashing
   * JWT + Authorization middleware
   * Input validations

2. **Optimized SQL**

   * Joins
   * Indexes for performance on queries

3. **Error handling + logging**

   * Detailed server responses

4. **Documentation**

   * README with architecture
   * ER diagram
   * API docs

5. **Deployment**

   * Backend: Render / Railway
   * Frontend: Vercel / Netlify
   * DB: Supabase (PostgreSQL in cloud)

---

## **Phase 4 — Resume Boosters (Optional Enhancements)**

* Doctor weekly availability schedule
* Appointment reminders (email)
* Dashboard charts (appointments per doctor/date range)
* Pagination + search

These give you:

* Complex SQL joins
* Backend business rules
* Authentication + role-based access
* Real-world project structure
